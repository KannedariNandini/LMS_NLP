Roy, S. Mehta, T. DeshmukhYear: 2023Problem Focused: Explores the integration of quantum computing to improve contextual understanding in auto-generated text.Algorithm used: Implements quantum-enhanced transformers for better semantic alignment in natural language models.Future Enhancement:Proposes leveraging quantum error correction to improve model robustness.Source: ElsevierThis paper explores the application of Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) to enhance the semantic analysis of automatically generated sentences. It discusses how quantum computing can help decode the structure and context of these sentences more efficiently than classical methods, making it particularly useful for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text summarization, and translation.Title: Hybrid Quantum Models for Text SummarizationAuthors:L. Chen, Y. Singh, D. PatelYear: 2022Problem Focused: Investigates the role of hybrid quantum-classical approaches in generating concise text summaries..Algorithm: Employs quantum circuit-based dimensionality reduction techniques for efficient summarization.Future Enhancement: plans to expand applications to cross-lingual summarization tasks.Source: IEEE XploreThis survey paper provides a detailed overview of the intersection between quantum computing and NLP, illustrating how quantum models can improve tasks such as text-to-image generation, text-to- scene, and text-to-video generation. It explores how quantum algorithms are applied to enhance NLP’s capabilities and discusses the potential for quantum computing to revolutionize language understanding.Title:Sentiment Analysis Using Quantum Neural Networks Author: R. Gupta, M. Verma, K. DasYear: 2024Problem Focused:Develops quantum-inspired neural networks for enhanced sentiment analysis of customer reviews.Algorithm:Introduces entanglement-based word embeddings for sentiment detection.Future Enhancement:Focuses on scaling these techniques for multilinguial datasetsSource:SpringerThis paper focuses on the challenges and opportunities presented by applying quantum computing to NLP. It addresses the difficulty of encoding linguistic information and how quantum models could surpass the limitations of classical neural language models. The study highlights potential areas for improvement and growth.Title: Quantum NLP: A New Frontier in Language ModelingAuthor:T. Nakamura, H. Kim, J. Lee Year: 2021Problem Focused:Studies the advantages of quantum computing in enhancing language modeling capabilities.Algorithm:Applies quantum tensor networks to capture complex dependencies in sentences.Future Enhancement: Envisions the integration of quantum memory for handling large corpora.Source: NatureIn this paper, the integration of quantum physics principles into NLP is reviewed, aiming to enhance language processing capabilities. The authors explore various quantum algorithms and their applications, particularly in semantic analysis and information retrieval tasks, with an emphasis on how quantum models can outperform classical NLP systems.Title:Quantam cognitive models for text classification Authors: N. Bhatia, S. Kapoor, V. AnandYear: 2023Problem Focused:Focuses on quantum-cognitive approaches for classifying auto-generated text into predefined categories.Algorithm: Uses quantum superposition states to represent overlapping categories efficiently.Future Enhancement: Targets real-time classification systems for dynamic text dataSource: ACM Digital LibraryThis paper provides an overview of how quantum computing can be applied to NLP tasks. It delves into the intersection between quantum models and language processing, focusing on areas like text-to-image generation, scene generation, and video generation.
